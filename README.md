# A cookie-cutter cryptocurrency tracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5. Built using Angular Router, Jasmine tests (they aren't part of the project yet, that's where you come in) and Tailwind CSS (prefer this to native CSS).

## Before you start

Get all the packages you need: `npm install` (`npm i`)

## Starting the development server

Run `ng serve` (`npm start` should also work if you are using npm) for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## How do I generate a new component?

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.

You can also use:

- `ng generate directive directive-name` to generate a new directive.
- `ng generate service service-name` to generate a new service.
- `ng generate pipe pipe-name` to generate a new pipe.
- `ng generate module module-name` to generate a new module.
- `ng generate interface interface-name` to generate a new interface.
- `ng generate enum enum-name` to generate a new enum.

Not sure if you'll need ALL of these for the issues, but doesn't hurt to know what the CLI can do. You could also just manually create the required files, you don't necessarily need to use the CLI (some projects may not even support the Angular CLI -- Oppia, for example, uses a webpack build system and consequently doesn't support these CLI commands).

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
